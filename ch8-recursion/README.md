# Chapter 8: Recursion and Dynamic Programming

## 8.1: Triple Step
A child  is  running  up a staircase with n steps  and  can  hop either 1 step,  2 steps, or  3 steps  at  a time.
Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child  can  run  up the stairs.

## 8.2 Robot in a Grid
Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r  rows and  c columns.
The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on  them.
Design an  algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.
